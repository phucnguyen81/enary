# Description
This is a project to help me do these little things in simplest way possible:

- quick note
- reminder
- timer
- calculate simple expressions

There are exelent tools for these but they are scattered and not configurable to my likings.
Since they are so easy to implement myself, lets just do them.

# Tools
JavaScript on Node.js makes sense for these kind of things.
It is a portable interpreter that has a potential to use browser for gui.

The readline package is basic for making interpreter.
